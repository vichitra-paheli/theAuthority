# Political Simulation Game Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains all documentation for the Political Simulation Game project - a web-based political simulation where players manage a local town through an immersive email interface, powered by AI-driven demographic responses.

## Documentation Structure

### Core Documents
- **[Game Design Document](game_design_document.md)** - Complete game design specification with technical architecture
- **[Vertical Slice Development Plan](vertical_slice_development_plan.md)** - 4-week focused development plan for minimal viable prototype
- **[Development Todo List](development_todos.md)** - Detailed task breakdown for all development phases

### Development Guidelines
- **[.cursorrules](../.cursorrules)** - Cursor IDE rules and coding standards for the project
- **Project Structure** - Organized folder structure for maintainable development

## Quick Start Guide

### For Developers
1. Read the [Vertical Slice Development Plan](vertical_slice_development_plan.md) for immediate next steps
2. Review the [.cursorrules](../.cursorrules) file for coding standards
3. Check the current todo list for task priorities
4. Follow the Phase 1 setup instructions to begin development

### For Stakeholders
1. Start with the [Game Design Document](game_design_document.md) for complete project overview
2. Review the [Vertical Slice Development Plan](vertical_slice_development_plan.md) for timeline and deliverables
3. Check development progress against the todo list

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
- Create an engaging political simulation with realistic consequences
- Implement AI-driven demographic responses for dynamic gameplay
- Build an intuitive email-based interface familiar to all users
- Develop a modular, extensible architecture for future expansion

### Success Metrics
- Complete vertical slice playable within 4 weeks
- AI responses generate within 10 seconds
- Interface feels like professional email software
- Game loop remains engaging for 10+ turns

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js + PostgreSQL
- **AI**: Ollama + ChatGPT-OSS (7B/20B models)
- **Development**: Docker + Vite + Vitest
