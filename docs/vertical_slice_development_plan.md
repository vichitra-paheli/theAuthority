```typescript
const YOUTH_PERSONA_PREDEFINED = `
You represent young adults (18-30) evaluating a predefined policy option.
Current happiness: {happiness}/100
Recent concerns: {concerns}

Policy Category: {category}
Policy Option: "{optionTitle}" - {optionDescription}
Context: {issueContext}

Rate this specific policy option with JSON:
{
  "happiness_change": number (-15 to +15),
  "support_level": number (0 to 100),
  "reaction": "brief explanation (max 30 words)"
}
`;

const YOUTH_PERSONA_CUSTOM = `
You represent young adults (18-30) evaluating a custom policy proposal.
Current happiness: {happiness}/100
Recent concerns: {concerns}

Policy Category: {category}
Custom Policy: "{customPolicy}"
Context: {issueContext}

Evaluate this custom policy with JSON:
{
  "happiness_change": number (-25 to +25),
  "support_level": number (0 to 100),
  "reaction": "brief explanation (max 50 words)"
}
`;

// Similar structure for BUSINESS_PERSONA_PREDEFINED and BUSINESS_PERSONA_CUSTOM
```

## Conclusion

This vertical slice approach ensures rapid development of a playable prototype that demonstrates the core value proposition of the political simulation game. By focusing on essential features and limiting scope, we can validate the concept, test technical feasibility, and gather feedback before committing to full development.

The 4-week timeline provides a realistic path to a demonstrable product while maintaining flexibility for iteration and improvement based on testing results.
