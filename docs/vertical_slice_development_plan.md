# Vertical Slice Development Plan
## Political Simulation Game

### Overview
This document outlines a focused vertical slice development approach for the political simulation game. A vertical slice represents a narrow but complete implementation of core gameplay mechanics, providing a playable prototype that demonstrates the full game loop with minimal content.

## Vertical Slice Scope

### Core Features to Implement
1. **Single Turn Gameplay Loop**
   - One complete turn cycle from email reading to policy implementation
   - Immediate feedback and state changes
   - Basic turn advancement

2. **Minimal Viable Demographics (2 instead of 4)**
   - **Youth Demographic**: Tech-savvy, employment-focused
   - **Business Owners**: Economy and tax-focused
   - Simplified AI personas with consistent JSON responses

3. **Essential Simulation Variables**
   - Budget (income/expenses)
   - Overall Approval Rating
   - Economic Health
   - Youth Happiness
   - Business Satisfaction

4. **Basic Email Interface**
   - Simple inbox with 3-5 pre-written emails
   - Policy composition form
   - Turn results display

5. **Minimal AI Integration**
   - Local LLM setup with basic prompts
   - Two demographic agents
   - Simple response parsing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Minimal Tech Stack
```json
{
  "frontend": {
    "framework": "React 18 + TypeScript",
    "build": "Vite",
    "styling": "Tailwind CSS",
    "state": "Zustand",

```

### Core Data Structures
```typescript
interface GameState {
  turnNumber: number;
  budget: number;
  approvalRating: number;
  economicHealth: number;
  demographics: {
    youth: DemographicState;
    business: DemographicState;
  };
  activeEvents: Event[];
  policyHistory: Policy[];
}

interface DemographicState {
  happiness: number; // 0-100
  concerns: string[];
  lastPolicyReaction: string;
  supportLevel: number; // 0-100
}

interface Email {
  id: string;
  from: string;
  subject: string;
  body: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  type: 'issue' | 'result' | 'event';

```typescript
const YOUTH_PERSONA = `
You represent young adults (18-30) in a local town government simulation.
Current happiness: {happiness}/100
Recent concerns: {concerns}

Evaluate this policy proposal: "{policy}"

Respond with JSON only:
{
  "happiness_change": number (-20 to +20),
  "support_level": number (0 to 100),
  "reaction": "brief explanation (max 50 words)"
}
`;

const BUSINESS_PERSONA = `
You represent local business owners in a town government simulation.
Current satisfaction: {satisfaction}/100
Economic concerns: {concerns}

{
  "satisfaction_change": number (-20 to +20),
  "economic_impact": number (-10 to +10),
